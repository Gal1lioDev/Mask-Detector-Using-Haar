# Mask-Detector-Using-Haar
Running this program will show a window that will be taking taking your video. 
At the same time it will also show a bounding box around your face.
The color of the box will depend on whether you are wearing a face mask or not.
There will be a text above the bounding box telling whether you are wearing a face mask or not along with its confidence level.
There maybe some imperfections, as the model that detects whether you are wearing a face mask is made from scratch using the keras library.
